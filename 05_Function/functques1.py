""" Ques1. Basic Function Syntax
Problem: Write a function to calculate and return the square of a number."""


def square_of_num(number):
    return number ** 2
# In function we use return to give the value, because of return any variable can hold the value of return but if we use print() instead of return, it print on console but no variable can have value, if we try to store, variable will return NONE.

value = square_of_num(5)
print(value) # here if we dont use print the value not come on console but the file gets run without anything
